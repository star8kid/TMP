# TMP
TMP stands for "The Mint Project", where I will document my progress in constructing a display helmet made of LED matricies and other features

## Motive
This project is something I've wanted to do for a long time. In addition to being a personal project, I aim to use the project as a way to practice my programming skills and expand my own knowledge on microcontroller hardware in general. Additionally, when I am "done", I plan on creating a guide on my process, how to modify in a what that alligns with my OOP design, as well as what challenges I had as a "novice" programmer.

## Currently Projected Plans
- Early Stages:
    - Define several basic displays for "emotes"
    - Provide support for animations 
    - Define basic methods for doing I/O between displays and animations
- Mid-Stages:
    - Refactor and reorganize previous methods for displays/animations as needed
    - Create schematic diagrams / step-by-step guides for construction and necessary materials
- Late-Stages:
    - Look into expanding features
    - Special features??
