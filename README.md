# TMP
TMP stands for "The Mint Project", where I will document my progress in constructing a display helmet composed of LED Matrices, sensors in an easy-to-use environment for building your own display helmet!

## Motive
This project is something I've wanted to do for a long time. In addition to being a personal project, I aim to use the project as a way to practice my programming skills and expand my own knowledge on microcontroller hardware in general. Additionally, when I am "done", I plan on creating a guide on my process, how to modify aspects of my design if you'd like to make changes for your own uses.

## Currently Projected Plans (Updated as of 12/29/25)
- Early Stages:
    - Define several basic displays for "emotes"
    - Provide support for animations 
    - Define basic methods for doing I/O between displays and animations
- Mid-Stages:
    - Refactor and reorganize previous methods for displays/animations as needed
    - Create schematic diagrams / step-by-step guides for construction and necessary materials
    - Implement Microphone
- Late-Stages:
    - Finish refactoring and debugging
    - Build example scripts for the repository
    - Show design process
